        <h2>A Solitary Hunter</h2>
        <p>
          The leopard is the most elusive and secretive of the big cats. A
          master of camouflage, it can go unseen just meters away. They are
          incredibly adaptable, found in habitats ranging from dense jungles to
          arid deserts, a testament to their solitary and resourceful nature.

        <h2>Unmatched Agility</h2>
        <p>
          Renowned for their climbing ability, leopards often haul their kills
          up trees to keep them safe from other predators. Their powerful build
          allows them to be pound-for-pound one of the strongest climbers in the
          animal kingdom, navigating the canopy with silent grace.

        <h2>Camouflage Masters</h2>
        <p>
          Leopards are renowned for their stunning rosette patterns, which provide perfect camouflage in their varied habitats. Each leopard's spots are unique, like a fingerprint, allowing them to blend seamlessly into dappled sunlight, shadows, and foliage. This adaptation makes them nearly invisible to both prey and predators.

        <h2>Diet and Hunting</h2>
        <p>
          As opportunistic carnivores, leopards have a diverse diet that includes antelopes, deer, monkeys, and even smaller predators like hyenas. They are stealthy hunters, often stalking prey for hours before launching a powerful ambush. Leopards can take down animals much larger than themselves, showcasing their incredible strength and precision.

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>
          Leopards are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Despite their adaptability, leopard populations are declining in many areas. Conservation efforts focus on protecting habitats and reducing illegal wildlife trade.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "Did you know? Leopards can carry prey up to 3 times their own body weight up trees to keep it safe from scavengers!"

        <h2>The Leopard's Love Story</h2>
        <p>
          Leopards lead solitary lives, but during mating season, males and females come together in brief, intense encounters. A male leopard may mate with multiple females, and after a gestation period of about 90-105 days, a female gives birth to 2-4 cubs in a hidden den. The cubs are born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mother for protection and nourishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first few months, the mother leopard fiercely guards her cubs, teaching them essential hunting skills while keeping them safe from predators. Leopard cubs stay with their mother for up to two years, learning the art of stealth and survival in the wild. This close bond ensures the next generation masters the leopard's legendary camouflage and hunting prowess.
