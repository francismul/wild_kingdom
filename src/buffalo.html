        <h2>Power in Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          The Cape Buffalo is one of the most formidable animals in Africa, not
          because of solitary strength, but due to the power of the collective.
          They live in large herds, grazing across the savanna, and are renowned
          for their exceptional memory and defensive tactics against predators.

        <h2>An Unforgiving Defense</h2>
        <p>
          Known for their unpredictable nature, buffalo are highly protective of
          their herd. When threatened, they form a defensive wall, facing the
          danger head-on. They have been known to chase predators away and even
          return to rescue a captured member, showcasing a level of group
          cohesion rarely seen.

        <h2>The Mighty Horns</h2>
        <p>
          Cape Buffalo possess some of the most impressive horns in the animal kingdom. Their horns are fused at the base, forming a continuous shield called a "boss" that protects the head and neck. These horns can span up to 1.5 meters and are used not only for defense but also for digging water holes and foraging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many other bovines, both male and female buffalo have horns, though males typically have larger ones. The horns grow throughout their lives and are a symbol of their strength and experience.

        <h2>Daily Life and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Buffalo are primarily grazers, spending up to 18 hours a day eating grass. They migrate seasonally following rainfall patterns and water sources. Despite their tough exterior, they are susceptible to diseases like bovine tuberculosis, which they can transmit to other animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Socially complex, buffalo form strong bonds within their herds. They communicate through grunts, snorts, and body language. Older, more experienced buffalo often lead the herd, using their knowledge to find food and avoid danger.

        <h2>The Buffalo's Role in Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>
          As mega-herbivores, Cape Buffalo play crucial roles in maintaining African savannas. Their grazing prevents woody encroachment and promotes grass growth. They create water holes that benefit many other species, and their dung provides nutrients for soil and food for insects and small animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buffalo also serve as prey for apex predators like lions and crocodiles, helping maintain the balance of the food chain. Their presence indicates a healthy ecosystem.

            While not currently endangered, Cape Buffalo face threats from habitat loss, disease, and human-wildlife conflict. Their populations are stable but require ongoing protection.

        <h2>Myths and Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Buffalo have deep cultural significance in many African societies. They represent strength, resilience, and community. In some cultures, they are seen as symbols of abundance and are featured in traditional ceremonies and artwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "buffalo soldier" was used for African American soldiers in the US military, referencing their strength and the respect they commanded. Buffalo also appear in Native American folklore as symbols of sacred power.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Human-Buffalo Conflict</h2>
        <p>
          As human populations expand, conflicts with buffalo increase. Buffalo can damage crops and pose threats to people, leading to retaliatory killings. Conservation efforts focus on creating corridors for buffalo migration and implementing non-lethal deterrents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sustainable solutions include electric fencing, early warning systems, and community education programs that help people coexist with these powerful animals.
