        <h2>The Bonds of Family</h2>
        <p>
          Elephants are known for their complex social structures, led by the
          oldest and often largest female in the herd. These matriarchs guide
          their families, passing down knowledge through generations. Their deep
          emotional intelligence is evident in their greetings, their care for
          the young, and their mourning of the lost.

        <h2>An Unforgettable Memory</h2>
        <p>
          The saying "an elephant never forgets" is rooted in truth. Their large
          temporal lobes allow for incredible memory, enabling them to recall
          locations of water sources, recognize other elephants and humans they
          have met, and remember complex social interactions for their entire
          lives.

        <h2>The Mighty Tusks</h2>
        <p>
          An elephant's tusks are actually elongated incisor teeth that continue
          to grow throughout their lives. These impressive appendages serve
          multiple purposes: digging for water, stripping bark from trees, and
          as formidable weapons against predators. Unfortunately, the demand for
          ivory has made tusks a target for poachers, leading to the tragic
          removal of these vital tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          African elephants have larger tusks than their Asian counterparts, and
          both males and females can have tusks, though in some populations,
          tuskless females are becoming more common due to selective poaching
          pressures.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Communication and Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
          Elephants communicate through a complex system of sounds, including
          infrasound that can travel over long distances. They can detect these
          low-frequency rumbles through their feet and trunks. Their
          intelligence is remarkable - they can recognize themselves in mirrors,
          show empathy, and even mourn their dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elephants have been observed using tools, solving problems, and
          displaying self-awareness. Their emotional depth is evident in their
          strong family bonds and their ability to remember individuals for
          decades.

            Elephants face severe threats from habitat loss, poaching, and
            human-wildlife conflict. With populations declining rapidly, urgent
            action is needed to protect these gentle giants.

        <h2>Daily Life in the Herd</h2>
        <p>
          Elephant herds are led by wise matriarchs who guide their families to
          food and water sources they've remembered for years. Calves stay with
          their mothers for up to 16 years, learning essential survival skills.
          Elephants spend most of their day eating, consuming up to 150 kg of
          vegetation daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          They require vast territories to roam, and their migration patterns
          are crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems. When elephants move
          through landscapes, they create pathways that other animals use and
          help disperse seeds through their dung.

        <h2>Elephant Myths and Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Elephants hold special places in many cultures. In Hinduism, the
          elephant-headed god Ganesha symbolizes wisdom and prosperity. African
          cultures often view elephants as symbols of strength and memory.
          Despite their gentle nature, elephants have been featured in war,
          work, and ceremony throughout human history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase "elephant in the room" refers to an obvious problem that
          people avoid discussing, while "elephant memory" celebrates their
          remarkable recall abilities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Conservation Hope</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the challenges, there are success stories. Community-led
          conservation in places like Kenya and Tanzania has reduced poaching
          and restored habitats. Anti-poaching technology, including drones and
          DNA tracking, is helping protect elephants. Education and sustainable
          tourism provide economic incentives for conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every effort counts in saving these magnificent creatures. From
          supporting conservation organizations to choosing ivory-free products,
          individuals can make a difference in elephant survival.
