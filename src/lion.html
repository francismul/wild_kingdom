        <h2>A Symbol of Power and Majesty</h2>
        <p>
          The lion has been admired for centuries as a symbol of courage,
          strength, and nobility. Living in social groups called prides, these
          magnificent predators roam the grasslands of Africa, their powerful
          roars echoing across the plains. They are the only cats to live in
          groups, a testament to their complex social bonds.
        </p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Pride Social Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Lions live in groups called prides, typically consisting of 5-15
          individuals including several adult females, their cubs, and one or
          two adult males. The females do most of the hunting and cub rearing,
          while males defend the territory and protect the pride from intruders.
          This cooperative social structure allows lions to take down large prey
          and provides safety for the young.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pride dynamics are complex, with coalitions of males often working
          together to take over and defend prides. The dominant male sires most
          of the cubs, but when a new male takes over, he may kill existing cubs
          to bring the females back into estrus sooner.

        <h2>Hunting Masters of the Plains</h2>
        <p>
          Lions are apex predators with incredible hunting skills. They work
          together in coordinated attacks, with lionesses using stealth and
          teamwork to get close to prey before launching their assault. Their
          powerful muscles and sharp claws make them formidable hunters capable
          of taking down animals much larger than themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite their reputation as lazy, lions actually hunt successfully
          about 25% of the time. They prefer to hunt at night when their prey is
          less alert, and they can consume up to 40 kg of meat in a single
          feeding session.

        <h2>The Mighty Roar</h2>
        <p>
          A lion's roar can be heard up to 8 kilometers away, serving multiple
          purposes: marking territory, communicating with pride members, and
          intimidating rivals. The roar is produced by the larynx and reinforced
          by specialized vocal folds that allow lions to make sounds at
          frequencies as low as 25 Hz.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each lion has a unique roar pattern, allowing pride members to
          recognize each other. The roar can also signal hunting success or warn
          of approaching danger, making it a vital communication tool in the
          wild.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Manes and Mating</h2>
        <p>
          The magnificent mane of a male lion is not just for show - it serves
          as protection during fights and signals dominance and health to
          potential mates and rivals. Darker, fuller manes indicate stronger,
          healthier males. Lionesses choose mates based on mane quality and
          fighting ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mating season brings intense competition among males. Dominant males
          mate with multiple lionesses in their pride, but must constantly
          defend their position from younger, stronger challengers.

        <h2>Daily Life in the Pride</h2>
        <p>
          Lions spend most of their time resting and conserving energy, but when
          active, they engage in complex social behaviors. Cubs play-fight to
          develop hunting skills, while adults maintain pride bonds through
          grooming and nuzzling. The pride operates as a well-coordinated unit,
          with each member playing a specific role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Territory size varies greatly depending on prey availability, ranging
          from 20 to 400 square kilometers. Lions mark their boundaries with
          urine and roar to warn intruders away.

        <h2>Lions in Culture and Mythology</h2>
        <p>
          Lions have captured human imagination for millennia. In ancient Egypt,
          lions symbolized power and were associated with the goddess Sekhmet.
          The lion appears in countless coats of arms, national flags, and
          sports team mascots. The "Lion of Judah" is a prominent symbol in
          Ethiopian culture and Rastafarianism.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mythology, lions appear as both benevolent protectors and fierce
          adversaries. The Nemean Lion of Greek mythology was slain by Hercules,
          while the lion Aslan in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia represents
          wisdom and sacrifice.
